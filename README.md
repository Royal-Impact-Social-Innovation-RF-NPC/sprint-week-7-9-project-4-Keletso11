# autonomous_assistiveRobot
An Arduino-based autonomous robot system that actively detects and avoids obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and DC motors. This project integrates real-time decision-making using sensor fusion and is designed to be expanded with ESP32-based Bluetooth app control.

---

## Project Overview

The robot uses three ultrasonic sensors (front, left, right) to detect objects in its surroundings. Depending on the sensor readings, it decides whether to move forward, turn left/right, or reverse. Directional LEDs indicate the movement chosen by the robot. The robot is driven by two DC motors connected via an L298N motor driver and controlled using PWM output.
